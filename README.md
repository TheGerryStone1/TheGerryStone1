### Hi! I'm Gerardo! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm a senior CS student at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey and an incoming Uber intern for Summer 2023! I'm very interested in backend development, focused on the design and architecture of complex applications and APIs.

I have interned at Uber and have done some pro bono work for Ternium and Wizeline. I've worked on various projects, such as having developed a game used for the capacitation process of employees and I'm currently working on the development of an enterprise management application using Open AI's API to optimize certain processes of management. [Here is my resume!](https://thegerrystone1.github.io/resume/)
